            <p>One morning last week, Jeanette Salcedo rose from her bed around 7:30 to get ready for work. She stepped into the shower and braced herself. For the fourth day in a row, the hot water was running lukewarm, already depleted by earlier risers like her son. If she wanted hot water, she would need to wait until around 9:15.</p>
            
            <p>For Salcedo, president of the Castle Hill Houses Tenants Association in the South Bronx, enduring this consistent infrastructure failure sets her mood for the entire day, leaving her feeling defeated.</p>
            
            <div class="quote-box">
                <p class="quote">“You just suck it up,” she said, “and you get out and you start your day".</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>When these problems happen, Salcedo calls 311, and the New York City Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) logs her call among the thousands of complaints from across New York City.</p>

        <section id="data-crisis">
            <h2>Bronx residents suffer the most</h2>
            <p>The data confirms that the Bronx suffers far more from heating and hot-water problems than all other boroughs. Each of the last three winters, complaints from the Bronx made up a third of all 311 heating complaints in the city.</p> 
            <p>These complaints refer specifically to tenant reports that a landlord is not providing the legally required hot water or indoor heat, in their apartments or the entire building.</p>


            <section id="legal-context">
            <h2>Legal Requirements for Heat and Hot Water</h2>
            <p>Under the <a href="https://nycadmincode.readthedocs.io/t27/c02/sch02/art08/">  New York City Administrative Code </a>, building owners must provide hot water to their tenants 365 days a year at a constant minimum temperature of 120 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
            <p>During the official “heat season” (Oct. 1 to May 31):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>They must maintain a minimum indoor temperature of 68 degrees Fahrenheit from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. if the outdoor temperature falls below 55.</li>
                <li>At night, indoor temperature must remain above 62 degrees from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., regardless of outdoor temperature.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        
            <p>The data shows heating conditions have been worsening across New York City, but the Bronx has consistently been the epicenter of winter distress in the past three years. Complaints dipped slightly in 2023 but surged again in 2024 and spiked sharply in early 2025, making the past winter the worst in the dataset.</p>

            <p>In the 2024-25 “heat season” alone, from Oct. 1 2024 to May 31 2025, HPD logged 280,000 heat and hot-water complaints, according to an analysis of <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9/data_preview"> 311 data </a> over three years. The data confirms that the Bronx suffers far more** from heating and hot-water problems than all other boroughs. Each of the last three winters, complaints from the Bronx made up a third of all 311 heating complaints in the city.</p>
            
            <p>Brooklyn consistently ranked second, with complaints surpassing 60,000 every heat season. Staten Island consistently logged the lowest number of heating complaints.</p>

        <section id="systemic-issues">
            <h2>Frequency, Not Response Time, is the Problem</h2>
            <p>The challenge isn’t slow response times, as city records show that 95%-99% of complaints are resolved within four days. Only 1% to 5% of cases lingered past five days, with Manhattan showing the highest share of slower resolutions. Virtually no complaints remain open past 10 days.</p>
            
            <p>The problem is the frequency and repetition of the service disruptions, demonstrating a chronic system failure.</p>
            
            <div class="quote-box">
                <p class="quote">"Housing has the best of the best, people who know their s***," Salcedo, who used to work for HPD, said. "But there's so much work to do, they never get ahead."</p>
            </div>

            <p>In some developments, like Morris Houses in the South Bronx, structural woes and aging infrastructure compound the problem.</p> 

            <div class="quote-box">
                <p class="quote">"In the wintertime, there's always at least one building, one line, that doesn't have any heat,” said Regina Carter, president of the Morris Houses Tenants Association."</p>
            </div>

            <p>Even when the heat is on, she said, her apartment remains cold because it isn't well insulated. Drafts come in because the windows do not fit in the frames perfectly.</p>

       
        </section>

<section id="systemic-issues">
            <h2>Complaint volumes are rising citywide</h2>
            <p>Last heat season, the Bronx logged more than 100,000 heating-related complaints, the highest of all boroughs.</p>
            <p>Brooklyn consistently ranked second, with complaints surpassing 60,000 every heat season. This past winter, it surpassed 70,000.</p>
            <p>Manhattan, while third in total complaints, had the highest share of slow closures. About 5% of Manhattan cases took more than five days to resolve, far higher than other boroughs.</p> 
            <p>The volume of complaints increased 5% year-on-year from the 2022–2023 season to 2023–2024. The increase spiked to 19% from 2023–2024 to 2024–2025. 
            <p>Among the boroughs, Brooklyn and Manhattan have shown steadily increasing heating system strain.</p>
            <p>Staten Island consistently logged the lowest number of heating complaints, hovering around the 3,000 mark, and was thus excluded from this analysis.</p>
